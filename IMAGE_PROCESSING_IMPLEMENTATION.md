## CURRENT STATUS

**Current Phase:** Phase 5 - API Updates (Nearly Complete)  
**Current Task:** Deployed staging folder support - Ready for E2E testing  
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-30 14:10 UTC

**Progress Summary:**

- ‚úÖ Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup (COMPLETE)
- ‚úÖ Phase 2: Lambda Container Code (COMPLETE)
- ‚úÖ Phase 3: Lambda Deployment (COMPLETE)
- ‚è≥ Phase 4: End-to-End Testing (READY TO START)
- üöß Phase 5: API Updates (IN PROGRESS - Get/List Listing endpoints complete, staging folder deployed)

---

## ISSUES / BLOCKERS

### Resolved Issues:

1. ‚úÖ **Docker build failures** - Fixed by using Sharp's bundled libvips + custom libheif
2. ‚úÖ **Multi-platform manifest error** - Fixed with `--provenance=false --sbom=false` flags
3. ‚úÖ **Reserved concurrency error** - Account limit is only 10 concurrent executions total

---

## NOTES

- Using EventBridge ‚Üí SQS ‚Üí Lambda (no event router Lambda)
- **No reserved concurrency** (account limit is 10 total, must keep 10 unreserved)
- Image formats: Full WebP (85%) + Thumbnail (400px, 85%)
- GuardDuty handles malware scanning automatically
- ECR cost: ~$0.07/month (negligible)
- Lambda specs: ARM64, 2048 MB RAM, 90s timeout, Node.js 20 container

---

## NEXT STEPS

### Immediate:

1. ‚úÖ **Enable GuardDuty Malware Protection** (COMPLETE)
2. ‚úÖ **Configure S3 bucket protection** (COMPLETE)
3. ‚úÖ **Update listing submission API to use staging/ folder** (COMPLETE - DEPLOYED)
4. **Test image upload to staging/ folder** (READY TO TEST)
5. Monitor EventBridge ‚Üí SQS ‚Üí Lambda flow
6. Test full E2E flow with real image uploads
7. Monitor CloudWatch metrics and logs
