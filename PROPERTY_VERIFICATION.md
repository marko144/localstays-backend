# Property Verification API

Two new verification flows for property listings: **Video Verification** and **Address Verification**.

---

## ðŸŽ¥ Property Video Verification

### Flow

1. Admin creates video request for a listing
2. Host receives email notification
3. Host uploads video (2-step: intent â†’ upload â†’ confirm)
4. Admin reviews and approves/rejects
5. Host receives outcome email

### Admin APIs

  "success": true,
  "requestId": "req_abc123",

  "status": "REQUESTED",
  "listingId": "listing_xyz",
  "hostId": "host_123",
  "createdAt": "2025-10-28T21:00:00Z"

## ðŸ“Š Request Status Flow

### Live ID Check & Video Verification

Both use the same status flow:

```
REQUESTED â†’ RECEIVED â†’ VERIFIED (approved)
         â†˜          â†˜ REJECTED (rejected)
```

- `REQUESTED`: Admin creates request, host notified
- `RECEIVED`: Host uploads video, awaiting admin review
- `VERIFIED`: Admin approves
- `REJECTED`: Admin rejects (with optional reason)

### Address Verification

```
REQUESTED â†’ VERIFIED (code correct)
         â†˜ REJECTED (3 failed attempts or admin rejection)
```

- `REQUESTED`: Admin creates request, code generated & PDF created
- `VERIFIED`: Host enters correct code (auto-approved)
- `REJECTED`: 3 incorrect attempts (auto-rejected) or admin rejection

**Note:** Address verification requests do NOT go through `RECEIVED` status since there's no upload to review - the code validation is automatic.

---

## ðŸ”‘ Request Types

```typescript
type RequestType =
  | "LIVE_ID_CHECK"
  | "PROPERTY_VIDEO_VERIFICATION"
  | "ADDRESS_VERIFICATION";

type RequestStatus =
  | "REQUESTED" // Created, awaiting host action
  | "RECEIVED" // Host submitted, awaiting admin review
  | "PENDING_REVIEW" // Under admin review
  | "VERIFIED" // Approved
  | "REJECTED"; // Rejected
```

---

## ðŸ“§ Email Notifications

**Video Verification:**

- Host receives email when request is created
- Host receives email when video is approved
- Host receives email when video is rejected (with reason)

**Address Verification:**

- Host receives email when request is created (code is in mail, not email)
- Host receives email when code is verified
- Host receives email when verification fails (too many attempts)

All emails support English and Serbian based on host's `preferredLanguage`.

## ðŸŽ¨ Frontend Implementation Tips

### Display Request Status

```typescript
const statusColors = {
  REQUESTED: "yellow",
  RECEIVED: "blue",
  PENDING_REVIEW: "blue",
  VERIFIED: "green",
  REJECTED: "red",
};
```

### Video Upload Progress

```typescript
// 1. Get pre-signed URL from submit-video-intent
// 2. Show file picker (max 200MB, mp4/mov/webm)
// 3. Upload with progress tracking:
const xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
xhr.upload.addEventListener("progress", (e) => {
  const percent = (e.loaded / e.total) * 100;
  updateProgressBar(percent);
});
xhr.open("PUT", uploadUrl);
xhr.setRequestHeader("Content-Type", videoContentType);
xhr.send(videoFile);
// 4. On success, call confirm-video
```

### Code Input Validation

```typescript
// 6 characters, alphanumeric, case-sensitive
const codePattern = /^[A-Za-z0-9]{6}$/;
```

### Request Cards

```typescript
interface RequestCardProps {
  requestType: "PROPERTY_VIDEO_VERIFICATION" | "ADDRESS_VERIFICATION";
  status: RequestStatus;
  description: { en: string; sr: string };
  createdAt: string;
  rejectionReason?: string;
}
```
