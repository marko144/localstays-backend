## 🏗️ New Architecture

### Stack Order (No More Circular Dependencies!)

```
Phase 1: Foundation (Independent)
├── 1. ParamsStack     (SSM Parameters)
├── 2. DataStack       (DynamoDB)
├── 3. StorageStack    (S3)
└── 4. KmsStack        (KMS Keys) ← NEW

Phase 2: Authentication (Dependent)
├── 5. CognitoStack    (depends on KmsStack)
└── 6. AuthTriggerStack (depends on all above)
```

**Key Innovation**: KmsStack breaks the circular dependency between Cognito and AuthTrigger!

## 🚀 Ready to Deploy

### Build Status: ✅ PASSING

```bash
npm run build
# Exit code: 0 (Success!)
```

### Deploy Command:

```bash
npx cdk deploy --all -c env=dev1
```

---

## 📋 Deployment Checklist

Follow these steps in order:

### Pre-Deployment

- [x] Code builds successfully
- [x] All stacks updated with stage parameter
- [x] Helper scripts created and executable
- [x] Documentation complete

### Deployment Steps (see DEPLOYMENT_INSTRUCTIONS_DEV1.md)

1. [ ] Run `npm run build`
2. [ ] Deploy: `npx cdk deploy --all -c env=dev1`
3. [ ] Copy SendGrid key: `./scripts/copy-sendgrid-key.sh dev dev1`
4. [ ] Attach Cognito triggers (manual CLI command)
5. [ ] Seed database: `TABLE_NAME=localstays-dev1 npm run seed`
6. [ ] Get frontend config: `./scripts/get-frontend-config.sh dev1`
7. [ ] Update frontend with new Cognito IDs
8. [ ] Test user signup flow

### Post-Deployment Verification

9. [ ] Test user signup works
10. [ ] Verify email received (SendGrid)
11. [ ] Check DynamoDB records created
12. [ ] Verify S3 folders created
13. [ ] Decode JWT and check custom claims

---

## 📊 Frontend Configuration Needed

After deployment, update your frontend config:

**Get Configuration**:

```bash
./scripts/get-frontend-config.sh dev1
```

**Update Frontend**:

```typescript
// OLD (dev)
const cognitoConfig = {
  userPoolId: "eu-north-1_BtUJVZhtP",
  clientId: "<old_client_id>",
  region: "eu-north-1",
};

// NEW (dev1) - Replace with actual values from script
const cognitoConfig = {
  userPoolId: "eu-north-1_XXXXXXX", // From CDK output
  clientId: "xxxxxxxxxx", // From CDK output
  region: "eu-north-1",
};
```

---

## ⚠️ Important Notes

### Cognito Advanced Security

**Current State**: Deployed with `AUDIT` mode (free tier)

**For CustomEmailSender to work**:

1. Upgrade Cognito to Plus tier in AWS Console (~$0.05/MAU)
2. Run:

```bash
aws cognito-idp update-user-pool \
  --user-pool-id <NEW_POOL_ID> \
  --user-pool-add-ons AdvancedSecurityMode=ENFORCED \
  --region eu-north-1
```

This is documented in detail in `DEPLOYMENT_INSTRUCTIONS_DEV1.md`.

## 🎯 Benefits Achieved

### 1. No Circular Dependencies

✅ KmsStack is now independent
✅ CognitoStack can be deployed before AuthTriggerStack
✅ Clean dependency tree

### 2. Multi-Environment Support

✅ Easy to create dev, dev1, staging, prod
✅ Environment config in `cdk.json`
✅ Single command deployment: `npx cdk deploy --all -c env=<name>`

### 3. Consistent Naming

✅ All resources: `localstays-{stage}-{resource}`
✅ All exports: `Localstays{Stage}{Export}`
✅ Easy to identify resources by environment

### 4. Prod-Safe Configuration

✅ Different removal policies for prod vs dev
✅ Deletion protection enabled for prod
✅ Environment-specific tags

### 5. Delta Deployments

✅ CDK only deploys changed stacks
✅ Fast updates (2-5 minutes for single stack)
✅ `--all` is safe (shows "no changes" for unchanged stacks)

---

## 🔄 Day-to-Day Workflow

### Making Changes to Lambda Code

```bash
# 1. Edit Lambda code in backend/services/
# 2. Build
npm run build

# 3. Deploy (CDK handles deltas)
npx cdk deploy --all -c env=dev1
# Only changed stacks will deploy!
```

### Adding a New Lambda

```bash
# 1. Write Lambda code
# 2. Add to AuthTriggerStack in infra/lib/auth-trigger-stack.ts
# 3. Build and deploy
npm run build
npx cdk deploy LocalstaysDev1AuthTriggerStack -c env=dev1
```

### Updating DynamoDB Schema

```bash
# 1. Edit data-stack.ts
# 2. Deploy
npx cdk deploy LocalstaysDev1DataStack -c env=dev1
```

## 📈 Future Enhancements

### Phase 3 (Optional - Not Implemented Yet)

These were discussed but not implemented. Can be added later:

1. **Custom Resource for Trigger Attachment**

   - Automate the manual Cognito trigger attachment step
   - Would eliminate Step 4 in deployment

2. **Unified DEPLOYMENT.md**

   - Merge all deployment docs into one comprehensive guide
   - Update README.md with quick start

3. **RBAC Documentation Consolidation**

   - Merge RBAC_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md into RBAC_SPECIFICATION.md
   - Delete redundant docs

4. **Deployment Orchestration Script**
   - Single command for complete setup
   - `npm run deploy:dev1` does everything

**Decision**: Keep it simple for now. Manual trigger attachment is acceptable.

## 🐛 Known Issues

### None Currently

Build is clean, all TypeScript compiles successfully.

## ✨ What's Different from Before?

### OLD (Before Refactor):

```bash
# Had to manually pass User Pool ID
npx cdk deploy --all -c userPoolId=eu-north-1_BtUJVZhtP

# Hard-coded "dev" everywhere
# Circular dependency between Cognito and AuthTrigger
# Had to create Cognito manually first
```

### NEW (After Refactor):

```bash
# Clean environment selection
npx cdk deploy --all -c env=dev1

# Environment in one place (cdk.json)
# No circular dependencies
# Can create everything in one deployment
```

---

## 🎉 Success Metrics

- ✅ **Build**: Clean (0 errors)
- ✅ **Architecture**: Circular dependency eliminated
- ✅ **Environments**: 4 supported (dev, dev1, staging, prod)
- ✅ **Documentation**: Complete deployment guide
- ✅ **Scripts**: 2 helper scripts created
- ✅ **Ready to Deploy**: Yes!
