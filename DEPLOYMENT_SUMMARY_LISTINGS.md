## üîç Verification Steps

### 1. Check DynamoDB for Seeded Enums

```bash
# Property Types
aws dynamodb query --table-name localstays-dev1 \
  --key-condition-expression "pk = :pk AND begins_with(sk, :sk)" \
  --expression-attribute-values '{":pk":{"S":"ENUM#PROPERTY_TYPE"},":sk":{"S":"VALUE#"}}'

# Amenities
aws dynamodb query --table-name localstays-dev1 \
  --key-condition-expression "pk = :pk AND begins_with(sk, :sk)" \
  --expression-attribute-values '{":pk":{"S":"ENUM#AMENITY"},":sk":{"S":"VALUE#"}}'
```

### 2. Test Get Metadata Endpoint

```bash
curl -X GET \
  https://tqaq505m83.execute-api.eu-north-1.amazonaws.com/dev1/api/v1/listings/metadata \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN"
```

Expected response:

```json
{
  "propertyTypes": [...],
  "amenities": [...],
  "checkInTypes": [...],
  "parkingTypes": [...],
  "verificationDocumentTypes": [...],
  "listingStatuses": [...],
  "amenityCategories": [...]
}
```

### 3. Check Lambda Functions

```bash
# List all listing-related Lambdas
aws lambda list-functions --query 'Functions[?starts_with(FunctionName, `localstays-dev1-`) && (contains(FunctionName, `listing`) || contains(FunctionName, `metadata`))].[FunctionName, Runtime, LastModified]' --output table
```

### 4. Check CloudWatch Logs

```bash
# Get metadata Lambda logs
aws logs tail /aws/lambda/localstays-dev1-get-listing-metadata --follow

# Submit intent Lambda logs
aws logs tail /aws/lambda/localstays-dev1-submit-listing-intent --follow
```

sk: LISTING_DOC#<listingId>#<documentType>
```

Contains: S3 key, content type, status, document type

## üéØ Next Steps

### Testing Checklist

- [ ] Test GET /listings/metadata endpoint
- [ ] Test full listing submission flow (submit-intent ‚Üí upload ‚Üí confirm)
- [ ] Test listing retrieval (get single, list all)
- [ ] Test soft delete functionality
- [ ] Verify subscription limit enforcement
- [ ] Test with multiple hosts
- [ ] Test error scenarios (invalid data, missing images, expired tokens)

### Future Enhancements

- [ ] PUT /listings/{listingId} - Update draft listings
- [ ] Image management endpoints (add, delete, reorder, set primary)
- [ ] Admin endpoints (approve, reject, lock listings)
- [ ] Listing search/filter by location, property type, price
- [ ] Listing analytics (views, bookings, revenue)

---

## üêõ Known Issues / Notes

1. **Update Draft Endpoint:** Intentionally skipped for now. Will be added later when needed.
2. **Image Limit:** Currently set to 15 images per listing.
3. **Subscription Enforcement:** Checks `maxListings` before allowing new listing creation.
4. **Soft Delete:** Cascade deletes all related records (images, amenities, documents).
